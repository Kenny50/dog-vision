# Dog Vision Simulator Chrome Extension

## Introduction
The Dog Vision Simulator Chrome Extension allows pet owners to experience the world from their dog's perspective. It simulates how dogs perceive images, aiding in the selection of pet toys and better understanding your furry friend.

**Special Thanks**: This extension is inspired by [András Péter](https://dog-vision.andraspeter.com/)'s work on dog vision simulation. We re-implemented his algorithm based on his articles.
